For Ansible, nearly every YAML file starts with a list. Each item in the list is a list of key/value pairs, 
commonly called a “hash” or a “dictionary”. So, we need to know how to write lists and dictionaries in YAML.


There’s another small quirk to YAML. All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) 
can optionally begin with --- and end with .... This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.

All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space):

fruits:
    - Apple

    - Strawberry
